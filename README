Fake IR remote control for a no-name 3-port "Mini HDMI Switch".

Hardware and software requirements are very low, an Arduino board / project is
only used due significant amounts of laziness.

Hardware setup: Connect an opto coupler (see schematic) to the Arduino's
pin 3. Then connect the opto coupler outputs to the HDMI Switch.

Software setup: Open a 9600 Baud serial terminal and send "1" to select input
1, "2" for 2 or "3" for 3. All other characters are silently ignored.
